Writing a function to calculate the sum of squares of a set of numbers
Define a function sum_squares (my_list) then,
                    Set total to 0,
                       X to 0,
                       My_length = len(my_list) + 1
                      While the value of x is less than the value of length, {
                         For each element i in my_list,{
                                     total =  i * i + total
                                     increase the value of x by 1 i.e
                                      x = x + 1
                                      }
                 return total
                        }
                        end
